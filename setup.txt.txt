We should change all the setup documentation

Installing TeamCity Server
After you obtained the TeamCity installation package, proceed with corresponding installation instructions:
Windows .exe distribution - the executable which provides the installation wizard for Windows platforms and allows installing the server as a Windows service;
.tar.gz distribution - the archive with a "portable" version suitable for all platforms;
.war distribution - for experienced users who want to run TeamCity in a separately installed Web application server. Please consider using .tar.gz distribution instead. .war is not recommended to use unless really required (please let us know the reasons).
Compared to the .war distribution, the .exe and .tar.gz distributions:
include a Tomcat version which TeamCity is tested with, so it is known to be a working combination. This might not be the case with an external Tomcat.
define additional JRE options which are usually recommended for running the server
have the teamcity-server startup script which provides several convenience options (e.g. separate environment variable for memory settings) and configures TeamCity correctly (e.g. log4j configuration)
(at least under Windows) provide better error reporting for some cases (like a missing Java installation)
under Windows, allow running TeamCity as a service with the ability to use the same configuration as if run from the console
come bundled with a build agent distribution and single startup script which allows for easy TeamCity server evaluation with one agent
come bundled with the devPackage for TeamCity plugin development.
may provide more convenience features in the future
